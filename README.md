##  Overview

**Project Prakriti** is a proof-of-concept for a multi-agent AI system designed to automate the creation of data-driven ecological restoration plans tailored for India's unique ecosystems. It leverages the power of Agentic AI, where specialized models collaborate like a team of experts to tackle the complex problem of land degradation and biodiversity loss.

This project was developed as a proposal for the **India AI Impact Generative AI Hackathon** (Track 3: Agentic AI).

##  Architecture

Project Prakriti is built on a foundation of IBM's open-source technologies and follows a multi-agent workflow:

1. **Climate Analyst Agent**: Analyzes historical climate data for a target region.  
2. **Biodiversity Strategist Agent**: Identifies key native and endangered species by querying a knowledge base.  
3. **Restoration Planner Agent**: Synthesizes all inputs to generate a comprehensive, actionable restoration plan.
